Power BI Log Analytics is a free tool, helping you to fetch the right insigth about your Power BI usage. This is a starter kit giving you a vision on what you can do and what
kind of data you can have.

As you can see, i used PowerShell to extract the data and save files in my local computer. You can tweak the shell to save the data into Azure Datalake. I also used my username,
you can use Service Principal for more security. I did it easy way to go fast :).

# Prerequisites

* PowerShell V7.0
* Power BI Administrator role

# Limitations

* The API call (`GetGroupsAsAdmin`) you must specicy a limitation parametre (`$top={$top}`) and the limitation is 5000. In case you have more than 5K Workspaces you'll be stuck ! in case you have several Premium capacity, then you can filter per capacity. So, lucky you are:).
* The API call (`Refreshables`) wil fetch only the data about the last refresh. In case your dataset refreshing several times per day, you'll get only the last status.
* There is an API (`Get Refresh History`) allows you to get the history refresh. But, you need to be part of each workspace.

# Versions
* 1.0.1 : Addinf new KPI in (`Refresh Schedule`) "Ratio Dataset Activity / Refreshs" giving you the balance between the usage of the dataset versus the refresh
* 1.0.0 :
